Get Started with Firebase Instance ID
=====================================

Thank you for installing the Firebase Instance ID Unity SDK. Instance ID
is intended to be used in conjunction with products that support
[Firebase A/B Testing](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ab-testing/):

* [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/unity/client)
* [Firebase Remote Config](https://firebase.google.com/products/remote-config/)

# Overview

You can use
[Instance ID](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/unity/class/firebase/instance-id/firebase-instance-id)
to test [Firebase A/B Testing](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ab-testing/)
or provide a unique identifier for each app instance and a mechanism to
authenticate and authorize actions like sending a message via Cloud Messaging.

# Using the Sample

This SDK is distributed with a sample project under the
`Assets/Firebase/Sample/InstanceId` directory. To configure and run the sample,
follow the instructions in `Assets/Firebase/Sample/InstanceId/readme.md`.

# Demos

game.  The source is available on
